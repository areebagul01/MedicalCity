                <p>Internal medicine or general medicine is the medical specialty dealing with the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of adult diseases. Internal medicine physicians (internists) are skilled in the management of patients who have undifferentiated or multi-system disease processes. Internists care for hospitalised and ambulatory patients and may play a major role in teaching and research.</p>

                <h3>General Surgery</h3>
                <p>General surgery, despite the name, is actually a surgical specialty. General surgeons not only perform surgeries for a wide range of common ailments, but are also responsible for patient care before, during, and after surgery. All surgeons must start their training in general surgery; many then go on to focus on another specialty.</p>

                <h3>ENT</h3>
                <p>If you have a health problem with your head or neck, your doctor might recommend that you see an otolaryngologist. That's someone who treats issues in your ears, nose, or throat as well as related areas in your head and neck. They're called ENT's for short. ENTs usually treat them with antibiotics, but if the infections keep coming back, they may recommend surgery.</p>
